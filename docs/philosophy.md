# Software Engineering Philosophy

This section outlines the core principles guiding how we design, implement, and maintain software. These principles exist to reduce ambiguity, prevent architectural drift, and ensure long-term maintainability.

## Core Values

!!! success "Explicit is always better than implicit"
    Code should leave no room for assumptions. Always favor clarity over cleverness.  
    Implicit behavior must be documented and justified when unavoidable.

!!! success "Descriptive naming is better than short-hand"
    Names should describe what something does or represents, even if it means typing more.  
    Abbreviations are acceptable only when they are universally understood, unambiguous and or defined in documentation.

!!! success "Consistency is king"
    Inconsistent code is harder to maintain than slow code. Matching the existing code style is crucial.  
    Local consistency within a module is preferable to global inconsistency across the codebase.

!!! success "Fail fast and prefer early returns over deeply nested conditionals"
    Guard against invalid states and exit as soon as a failure is detected.  
    This keeps control flow flat, readable, and easier to reason about.

!!! success "Test edge-cases early"
    If a function can fail, make it fail during development, not in production.  
    Use assertions, debug-only checks and logging generously where appropriate.

!!! success "Prioritize runtime performance"
    Every design choice should consider its impact on real-time execution.  
    Performance is not an afterthought — it's a primary goal, especially in hot code-paths.

!!! success "Optimize, optimize, optimize"
    Focus optimization efforts on performance-critical and hot code-paths.  
    Non-critical code should prioritize readability and correctness over micro-optimizations.

!!! success "Minimal state, maximal clarity"
    Avoid unnecessary shared or mutable state.  
    Favor local variables and or shared immutability where possible - const-correctness is key.

!!! success "Be predictable and deterministic"
    Code should behave as expected without surprises.  
    Avoid magic literals, hidden side-effects, global state dependencies, and undocumented behavior.

!!! success "Zero-cost abstractions"
    Abstractions must not introduce runtime overhead.  
    If an abstraction costs extra, it must be justified by a measurable and documented benefit.

!!! success "Avoid clever one-liners"
    Readability trumps cleverness.  
    If a trick saves a few keystrokes but hides intent, do not use it.

!!! warning "Never nest"
    Nesting types is the root of all evil, unless kept private, tightly scoped, or for a thin configuration struct.

!!! failure "Never ever use snake case"
    we_really_really_hate_snake_case!

!!! success "Quality through iteration"
    Improvements are driven by feedback, peer review, and refactoring.  
    Code quality is treated as a continuous process, not a one-time milestone.

## Design and Architecture Principles

!!! success "Simplicity beats generality"
    Solve the current problem well before designing for hypothetical future use-cases.  
    Over-generalization increases complexity and maintenance cost.

!!! success "Prefer composition over inheritance"
    Composition provides clearer ownership, better testability, and fewer implicit behaviors than deep inheritance hierarchies.

!!! success "Ownership must be obvious"
    Resource ownership and lifetime must be clear from the API alone.  
    If ownership is non-obvious, the design is wrong or under-documented.

!!! success "APIs are contracts"
    Public interfaces must be stable, well-documented, and difficult to misuse.  
    Breaking changes require explicit justification and coordination.

## Decision Considerations

When making engineering or architectural decisions, consider:

1. The impact on **readability** and **long-term maintenance**.
2. Alignment with existing **architecture**, **conventions** and standards.
3. Technical trade-offs and **future implications** considering the project's roadmap.
4. **Risk, complexity, scalability,** and testing cost
5. **Failure modes** and **debuggability**.

---

## Software Expectations

- Code must be **testable** and **demonstrably correct**.
- Peer-review is **strongly encouraged**.
- Documentation accompanies **new systems** and or **architectural decisions**.
- Breaking code may **not** be committed to **default branches** (`master`/`main`).

## Continuous Improvement

Intrynzic's standards are updated as our needs evolve alongside our projects and their requirements.  
Suggestions for changes are welcome and should be proposed appropriately and discussed collaboratively.
