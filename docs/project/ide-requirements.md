## IDE

Intricate development requires **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or newer**. A secondary text editor may also be used with **Visual Studio**, but should **not replace it**. Suggested secondary text editors are:

- VS Code
- Sublime
- Vim (DOS mode)
- Neovim (DOS mode)

!!! info ".EditorConfig"
    Intricate uses [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to enforce code-styling. For any other text editors, please ensure that they support **.editorconfig** before using them. For **VS Code**, this extension should be used: [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).
